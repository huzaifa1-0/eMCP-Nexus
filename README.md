# eMCP Nexus: The Smart Marketplace for On-Demand Compute

eMCP Nexus is a next-generation marketplace and platform for discovering, deploying, and monetizing developer tools, APIs, and Modular Compute Protocols (MCPs). Unlike traditional marketplaces that rely on keyword search, eMCP Nexus uses advanced vector search (FAISS) to understand the true functionality of tools‚Äîmaking discovery smarter, faster, and more relevant.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Semantic Vector Search:**
	- Find the right tool by describing what you want to do (e.g., "image recognition", "payment processing").
	- FAISS-powered search matches tools by meaning, not just keywords.

- **Instant MCP Deployment:**
	- Deploy any GitHub repository as a live, reusable Modular Compute Protocol (MCP) with one click.
	- No extra setup required‚Äîshare your code as a service instantly.

- **Crypto Micro-Payments:**
	- Pay only for what you use‚Äîno subscriptions required.
	- Flexible, affordable access to tools via crypto-based micro-payments.

- **Global Developer Ecosystem:**
	- Tools are discoverable, composable, and reusable by anyone, anywhere.
	- Accelerate innovation by sharing and integrating building blocks from around the world.
